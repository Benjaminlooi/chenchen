// Contract tests for authentication detection
// Authentication checks are now handled through the check_authentication command

// Note: These tests have been removed as the WebviewManager API changed.
// Authentication checking is now done via the check_authentication Tauri command
// which requires a full Tauri runtime context. See command tests for auth checking.

    // Placeholder test to prevent empty test file errors
